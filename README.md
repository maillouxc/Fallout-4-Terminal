# Fallout-4-Terminal
My attempt to recreate the hacking minigame from the terminals in Fallout 4. (The core concept of the minigame is similar in Fallout 3 
and New Vegas as well, but the exact execution is slightly different in each one. My implementation is intended to model as closely as 
possible the way it is done in FO4.)

I'm doing this as an exercise to build my own skills, especially with technologies that I haven't worked with before. It's my first 
programming project in a while, and my first one on GitHub. Since the majority of my programming life has been spent in the Java world, 
I figured I'd try to create this in C# so I could learn what life is like on the .NET framework side of things.

UPDATE: FINISHED! FINALLY! Er, well, as finished as I'm going to make it. It's not exactly where I wanted it to be, but I think I've
gotten all the knowledge and experience that this program can give me, and I need to move on to other things.

TO POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTORS: There are PLENTY of things left to do here. For example, make the cursor in the input column blink, fix bugs, 
fix the bug that occurs when a password spans between the two columns, Implement a journal system once you log in, where the user can
enter text and save it. Improve the code documentation. Write tests. Refactor! Improve the UI. The list goes, on and these items are
all great for building experience. Working in a codebase that you didn't write is a CRITICAL skill for new developers to build.
Submit your pull requests here with changes, and I will review and merge them regularly.

I'd absolutely love any feedback (positive or negative) or suggestions that anyone is willing to provide, as this is a learning 
experience for me. The best way to contact me is via email at mailloux.cl@gmail.com

If Bethesda decides that this infringes on copyright, I will take it down if requested.

Random Trivia: The game is basically a combination of the old game mastermind, and a hex dump program. (Just google that one).
