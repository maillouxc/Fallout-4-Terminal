# Fallout-4-Terminal
My attempt to recreate the hacking minigame from the terminals in Fallout 4. (The core concept of the minigame is similar in Fallout 3 
and New Vegas as well, but the exact execution is slightly different in each one. My implementation is intended to model as closely as 
possible the way it is done in FO4.)

I'm doing this as an exercise to build my own skills, especially with technologies that I haven't worked with before. It's my first 
programming project in a while, and my first one on GitHub, and it may take me a while to get it up and running.

Since the majority of my programming life has been spent in the Java world, I figured I'd try to create this in C# so I could 
learn what life is like on the .NET framework side of things. Naturally, this means I'm learning the language as I'm building the 
project, so a lot of my commits will undoubtedly be to undo things I previously did as I wrestle with an unfamiliar language trying to 
discover the best way to do everything.

So far, going from Java to C# was a much steeper learning curve than expected, but I think I'm starting to get the hang of things. 
I'm working on this in between my coursework, which is already on a tight schedule, so progress will likely be pretty slow, but my 
goal is to get it done before the end of October.

I'd absolutely love any feedback (positive or negative) or suggestions that anyone is willing to provide, as this is a learning 
experience for me. The best way to contact me is via email at mailloux.cl@gmail.com
