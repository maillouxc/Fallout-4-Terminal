# Fallout-4-Terminal
My attempt to recreate the terminals from Fallout 4, starting with the hacking mini-game. My goal is to get as close of a recreation as
possible to how it works in the game, as an exercise to build my own skills, especially with new technologies. I'll be starting with the 
hacking mini-game, but I'm considering adding the ability to create basic text files, as a  journal of sorts, and maybe ping a database
to store the entries online.

It's my first programming project in a long time, and my first one on GitHub, and it may take me a while to get it up and running.
My goal is to implement it in a language that I don't know, and I think I've settled on C# and the .NET platform, since I've got a fairly
good grasp on Java already.

Naturally, this means I have to learn the language before I can start working on the project, so it may be a while until any meaningful 
work is done.
